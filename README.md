## About

Legume Delight is an add-on for [Farmer's Delight](https://modrinth.com/mod/farmers-delight/), adding legume-based foods while following the same design philosophies as the base mod.

While making [a modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/desolate-planet/) with [Diet](https://modrinth.com/mod/diet/), I found the protein options in Farmer's Delight lacking unless you make animal farms. I couldn't find anything in other add-on mods to fill that gap, so I decided to make my own.

## Features

### 🫘 Beans

Beans are a hearty legume that can be made into Baked Beans, Bean Burgers, Chili, and more. Wild bean patches are found in temperate environments and drop beans, which can be planted or used in recipes.

If rope is placed above the bean crop, it will climb the rope (like Farmer's Delight tomatoes), allowing larger-scale farming and continual harvesting.

Ingredients:

*   Bean Patty
*   Refried Beans

_Technically, most of these foods would be made with different types of beans. Bean paste is usually from adzuki beans, baked beans from navy beans, bean patties are from black beans, etc. For simplicity's sake, I've decided to ignore that and abstract these into a single, ambiguous "bean"._

## Suggestions

You can reach me with suggestions or bug reports by making an issue on our [GitHub](https://github.com/pawjwp/Legume-Delight/issues) page. If preferred, I will respond to any messages in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/4en3SpWtJg) server for my current modpack, [Desolate Planet](https://modrinth.com/modpack/desolate-planet/). Feel free to reach out to me there as well.

I am happy to hear any and all suggestions. I personally play Farmer's Delight without any other add-ons, so I am likely unaware of compatibility changes that may be needed. If you notice anything that could be changed to ensure this mod works well with others, I would love to hear from you.
